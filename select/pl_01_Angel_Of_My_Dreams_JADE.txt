I wonder if one day that
you'll say that you care
Hey, Mike, let's do
somethin' crazy
If you say you love me madly
Angel of my dreams
I will always love you and
hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet
I will always want you and
need you, you don't care
You don't
Care
You don't care
You don't—
Care that I'm mad, care that
I'm sad
It's so bad, it's funny
Care if I cry, care if I die
You only care about money
(Money)
Sellin' my soul to a psycho
They say I'm so lucky
Better act like you're
lucky, honey
But it feels nice
In the spotlight
When the camera flashy, I act
so happy
I'm in heaven when
you're lookin' at me
Angel of my dreams
I will always love you and
hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet
I will always want you and
need you, you don't care
Love when you call me a star
You let me down in the dark
Want you and need you, you
don't care
It's not fair
(Ah)
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not f—
Fair that I try, fair that I cry
Fair that I buy you sushi
Got you a car, got you a house
Got you a suit, it's Gucci
If I don't win, I'm in the bin
You say you never knew me
But when I pop off you sue
me, so sue me
But it feels nice
(It feels nice)
In the spotlight
(In the spotlight)
When the camera flashy, I act
so happy
I'm in heaven when
you're lookin' at me
Angel of my dreams
I will always love you and
hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet
I will always want you and
need you, you don't care
Love when you call me a star
You let me down in the dark
Want you and need you, you
don't care
It's not fair
It's not fair
Angel of my dreams
I will always love you and
hate you, it's not fair
(Ah-ah)
It's so bittersweet
I will always want you and
need you, you don't care
I'll always love you
