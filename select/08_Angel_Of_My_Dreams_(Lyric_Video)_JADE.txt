I wonder if one day that you'll say that you care (hey, Mike)
If you say you love me madly- (let's do something crazy)

Angel of my dreams, I will always
Love you and hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet, I will always
Want you and need you, you don't care

You don't care
You don't care
You don't-

Care that I'm mad, care that I'm sad, it's so bad, it's funny
Care if I cry, care if I die, you only care about money (mm)
Sellin' my soul to a psycho, they say I'm so lucky
Better act like you're lucky, honey

But it feels nice
In the spotlight
When the camera flashy, I act so happy
I'm in heaven when you're lookin' at me

Angel of my dreams, I will always
Love you and hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet, I will always
Want you and need you, you don't care
Love when you call me a star
You let me down in the dark
Want you and need you, you don't care

It's not fair (ah)
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not f-

Fair that I try, fair that I grind, fair that I buy you sushi
Got you a car, got you a house, got you a suit, it's Gucci
If I don't win, I'm in the bin, you say you never knew me
But when I pop off, you sue me, so sue me

But it feels nice (it feels nice)
In the spotlight (in the spotlight)
When the camera flashy, I act so happy (happy)
I'm in heaven when you're lookin' at me

Angel of my dreams, I will always
Love you and hate you, it's not fair
It's so bittersweet, I will always
Want you and need you, you don't care
Love when you call me a star
You let me down in the dark
Want you and need you, you don't care

It's not fair
It's not fair

(I) angel of my dreams, I will always (wonder if one day that)
Love you and hate you (you'll say that), it's not fair (you care) (oh)
(I) it's so bittersweet, I will always (love you)
Want you and need you (forever), you don't care (I swear)

I'll always love you
